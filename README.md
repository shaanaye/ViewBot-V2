# ViewBot-V2

Taking advantage of Python's requests library to continually send requests to a desired listing on eBay to boosts its views and make it more likely to appear in user searches.

V2 will now monitor a specific account, search it for new listings, and add views to them. After, it will send webooks using the Discord library so users will know when their listings have been "viewed."
